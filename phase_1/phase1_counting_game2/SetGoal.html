    You have the option to set your own goal to complete within the twenty minutes of the game.
    This goal can be accepted and you will be reminded throughout the game how many more tables
    need to be completed to meet the goal. You can set a goal and click the Yes button if you
    would like to set the goal, or click the No button if you don't want to set a goal.
    {{ formfield 'goal_set_amount' label="Set your goal here:" }}

    <button name="goal_set" value="True">Yes</button>
    <button name="goal_set" value="False">No</button>
